-- «« Bishop Ireton Practice Hackathon
-- «« Difficulty: Easy  
-- «« Objective: Fill in the missing code so that:
--      1. A line is drawn connecting two points on the screen
--      2. When the user clicks with the left mouse button, one of the point's x,y location should change to be the location of the click.  When the user clicks with the right mouse button, the other point's x,y location should change to be the location of the click. 
--      3. A blue circle should be drawn at the same location as the vertice that corresponds to the left mouse click, and a red circle should be drawn at the same location that corresponds with the right mouse click in order to tell the two points apart from each other.
--      4. The distance between the two points should be displayed somewhere on the screen.

    --Declare variables called rightX and rightY and set them equal to arbitrary placeholder values such as 300 and 400
 



    --Declare a variable called dist and set it equal to the distance between the left and right point using math.dist method and the 4 variables we just declared

    --Display the distance between the two points
    --Try concatenating the dist variable to the end of a string which says something like "Distance = "
    --Try rounding the distance to be an integer using the math.floor method

    
    --Draw a line that connects the left and right points using the 4 variables declared in love.load()


    --Set the color to blue 

    --Draw the blue circle that corresponds with the left point


    --Set the color to red

    --Draw the red circle that corresponds with the right point
