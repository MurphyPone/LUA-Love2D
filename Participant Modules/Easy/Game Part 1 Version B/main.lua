-- «« Bishop Ireton Practice Hackathon
-- «« Difficulty: Easy  
-- «« Objective: Fill in the missing code so that:
--      1. The character image is drawn on the screen 
--      2. rotates around the center of the image to the left or right when the user presses the corresponding arrow keys
--      3. The character moves forward or backward when the user presses the corresponding arrow keys.
--      4. The character does not go off of the screen

  --Declare variables called x and y and set them both equal to 100

  --Declare a variable called angle and set its value to 0
	
  --Declare a variable called image and set it equal to a new image using the love.graphics.newImage() function.  Pass the name of the sprite.png image in this directory in quotations as the argument.

  --Declare a variable called speed and set it to any multiple of 100.  We recomend a number between 200 and 500.

  --Declare a variable called rotSpeed and set it to 5.  

  --Set the background color to something that will contrast the colors of the sprite.  We recomend (120,70,70)

  --Make sure the x and y offsets are positioned so that the new origin is in the center of the image
  --Hint: love.graphics.draw(drawable, x, y, scaleX, scaleY, offsetX, offsetY).  Use the suffix :getWidth() to get the width of an image for calculating the center of the image

    --the delta time (dt) parameter of love.update()
