-- «« Bishop Ireton Practice Hackathon
-- «« Difficulty: Medium  
-- «« Objective: Fill in the missing code so that:
--      1. The code from Game Part 1 is optimized 
--      2. rotates around the center of the image to the left or right when the user presses the corresponding arrow keys
--      3. The character moves forward or backward when the user presses the corresponding arrow keys.
--      4. The character does not go off of the screen

--      Bonus Question: What line causes the character to move slower when going backwards compared to forwards
--                      lines 50 & 51 divide speed/2
