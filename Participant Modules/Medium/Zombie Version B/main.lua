-- «« Bishop Ireton Practice Hackathon
-- «« Difficulty: Medium 
-- «« Objective: Fill in the missing code so that:
--      1. The zombie moves towards the mouse cursor when the left mouse button is clicked.  
--      2. The zombie's score increases when it collides with the fruit.  The fruit's location then changes to a random location but has to be entirely on the screen
--      3. A sound is played when the zombie collides with a fruit
--      4. A different sound is played when the zombie's score is greater than 10

-- Goodluck! The wiki and IPH staff are your friends.
