-- «« Bishop Ireton Practice Hackathon
-- «« Difficulty: Easy  
-- «« Objective: Fill in the missing code so that:
--      1. The button image that corresponds to the user's mouse input is displayed on the screen
--      2. The user's score and highscore are displayed on the screen
--      3. If the user clicks on a textfield that says "RESET", the highscore is reset
--      4. If the user's score is greater than the highscore, the highscore equals the player's new, higher score.
--		5. When the button is clicked, it moves to a new location entirely on the screen.

function love.load()
	--Declare a table called highscores which will hold the data we save to and load from

	--This checks if a file called "myFile.lua" exists in the LOVE filesystem directory which is located at:
		--Windows XP: C:\Documents and Settings\user\Application Data\LOVE\ or %appdata%\LOVE\

	--Set the value of the highscore variables to the third entry in the highscores table
	--Hint: Because all of the entries of the highscores table are string, you need to convert them to a numeric value using the tonumber() function
	

	--Declare three variables caleld unclicked, preclick, and clicked and set their values to the corresponding images in this directory
	



	--Declare a variable called currentButton and set its value to "unlclicked" for now
	

	--Declare a variable called buttonX and set its value to a positive multiple of 100

	--Declare a variable called buttonY and set its value to the vertical center of the screen

	--Declare variables called buttonW and buttonH and set their values to the width of the currentButton's width and height
	
	--Declare a variable called font and set it equal to a new 10pt font

	--Declare variables called resetX and resetY and set their values to be 750 and 10
	

	--Declare a variable called resetW and set its value to the width of the string "RESET" + 10

	--Declare a variable called resetH and set its value to the height of the string "RESET" + 6
