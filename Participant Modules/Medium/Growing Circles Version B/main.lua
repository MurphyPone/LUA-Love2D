-- «« Bishop Ireton Practice Hackathon
-- «« Difficulty: Medium  
-- «« Objective: Fill in the missing code so that:
--      1. When the user clicks the screen, a circle is drawn with its center at the mouse click's position
--      2. The circle should grow in size over time
--      3. The circle's transparency should decrease over time 
--      4. The circle should not be drawn if it has faded entirely
--		5. The user should be able to make multiple circles appear on the screen at once

-- Goodluck! The wiki and IPH staff are your friends.
