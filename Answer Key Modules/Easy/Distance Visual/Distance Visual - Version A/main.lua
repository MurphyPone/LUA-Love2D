-- «« Bishop Ireton Practice Hackathon
-- «« Difficulty: Easy  
-- «« Objective: Fill in the missing code so that:
--      1. A line is drawn connecting two points on the screen
--      2. When the user clicks with the left mouse button, one of the point's x,y location should change to be the location of the click.  When the user clicks with the right mouse button, the other point's x,y location should change to be the location of the click. 
--      3. A blue circle should be drawn at the same location as the vertice that corresponds to the left mouse click, and a red circle should be drawn at the same location that corresponds with the right mouse click in order to tell the two points apart from each other.
--      4. The distance between the two points should be displayed somewhere on the screen.

-- Goodluck! The wiki and IPH staff are your friends.
